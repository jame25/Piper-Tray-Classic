Piper Tray (Classic) is a small system tray utility for Windows, that utilizes [Piper](https://github.com/rhasspy/piper). It will read aloud the contents of your clipboard. You can stop the speech at any time either by using the 'Stop Speech' option, or via the hotkey (Alt + Q).

If you want more features, see: [Piper Tray](https://github.com/jame25/Piper-Tray). Alternatively, if you prefer a GUI; check out my other project: [Piper Read](https://github.com/jame25/piper-read).
